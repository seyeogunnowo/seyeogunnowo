# **HELLO, SEYE OGUNNOWO** HERE!
Hi! I'm a full-stack software developer. I build full-scale web applications using a combination of programming technologies and associated fameworks. I work with Python, Django, Django REST Framework, JavaScript, ReactJS, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS/SCSS and Git. I pretty much also design my UI and UX myself! Learning never stops for me, especially in the world of software development.

Most of my projects include proprietary code, as such, those repositories are not open. However, I have plans for open-source projects I'd love to collaborate on.
