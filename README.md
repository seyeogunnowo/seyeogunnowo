# **Hi, I'm Seye Ogunnowo!**
I'm a full-stack software developer. I build full-scale web applications using a combination of programming technologies and fameworks. I work with Python and JavaScript, but my full teck stack includes: Python, Django, Django REST Framework, JavaScript, ReactJS, PostgreSQL, HTML, CSS/SCSS and Git. I also design my UI and UX myself! Learning and growing never stops for me, especially in the world of software development.

Most of my projects include proprietary code, as such, those repositories are not open. However, I have plans for open-source projects I'd love to collaborate on.
